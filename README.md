# image2tag_training_test
hey, this is just a way to store and help improve a training pipeline ive been piecing together from documentation and other code i find around the internet, in an attempt to train a decent model using a 3050ti 4GB card. Which as of 7/19/25 is the only proper GPU i have to be able to train with.

# Wheres the code?:
Trained model files and code for them using different base models will be in different branches, this main branch is just used as a hub to store the other branches so im not making a new repository for each and so they are all sorted.
